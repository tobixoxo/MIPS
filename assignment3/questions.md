1. Write a program to create a calculator, where any of the operations can be performed 
(add, subtract, multiply, and divide) depending upon the choice entered by the user.  
2. Write a program to check whether the number entered by the user is prime or not.  
3. Use the logic developed in Q1 and write a program to print the prime numbers within 
a given limit. (entered by user, say-1 to 100)  
4. Write a program to print the “*” depending upon the integer entered by the user. Use 
the concept of loops.  
For example- If the user enters 5, then the output should look like-  
' * * * * * '
5. Write a program to make two arrays with the names employee_name and 
employee_id. Store the names and Ids’ of the employees in the corresponding indices 
in both the arrays in the memory.  
6. Write a program to print the sum of the integers in the following manner:  
For numbers from 1 to 20, take only even numbers.  
For numbers from 21 to 40, take only odd numbers.  
For numbers from 41 to 60, take even numbers multiplied with 3.  
Add the numbers and display the sum.
